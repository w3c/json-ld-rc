# JSON-LD Recommended Context

This is the repository for a recommended context for JSON-LD 1.1, developed and maintained by the [W3C JSON-LD Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/).

## Automatically Derived Files

On a pull request, the files used to build the context, Turtle, RDF/XML, and JSON-LD representations are built from the RDFa Initial Context in rdfa-1.1.html. These files should not be modified by hand.

Files are built using a [GitHub Workflow](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/workflows/) using a series of Ruby scripts to generate the associated files. The workflow is started when a Pull Request is created or updated.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.
