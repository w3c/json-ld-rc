# JSON-LD Recommended Context

This is the repository for a recommended context for JSON-LD 1.1, developed and maintained by the [W3C JSON-LD Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/).

## Automatically Derived Files

On a pull request, the files used to build the context, Turtle, RDF/XML, and JSON-LD representations are built from the RDFa Initial Context in rdfa-1.1.html. These files should not be modified by hand.

Files are built using a [GitHub Workflow](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/workflows/) using a series of Ruby scripts to generate the associated files. The workflow is started when a Pull Request is created or updated.

## Turtle Prefixes

In addition to the context, and RDF versions of the RDFa initial context, a Turtle file containing all prefix definitions is created as prefixes.ttl as part of the automatic integration.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informativeâ€”by including the issue or bug number for example.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.
